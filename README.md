***Note:*** This document is best viewed by clicking on this [github.io link](https://mdesai005.github.io/SE-SaaS/articles/solution-engineering-SaaS/index.html)

## The Role
Solutions Engineering is more BREADTH than depth. You take the products that have already been built - configure them with your business functional skills and integrate them with other products thereby building a “SOLUTION”. **This is primarily a techno-functional job** with client interactions and we are looking for good communications and potential business acumen as well. We are a "CUSTOMER FACING" organization. This role is focused on Public Sector Customers.

For a successful SaaS Solution Engineer - you need the following traits
* Strong business and functional skills
* Good understanding of Cloud Technology
* Good communication skills - you don’t build solutions for yourself -you build them for customers and the REAL world!
* Become proficient with demonstrating Oracle ERP or CXM or HCM Cloud
* Quickly understand the customer's usecase and build custom demo or proof of concepts with clients
* Deliver hands-on SaaS Cloud workshops
* Supporting Customer’s RFP/RFI/RFQ
* Learn to configure ERP modules by applying industry best practices
* Identify business requirements and map them to the Oracle Cloud ERP functionality
* Identify functionality gaps and develop solutions to them
* Configure the applications and document application set-ups
* Creating new public sector industry focused solution innovations
* Ability to work under tight deadlines - our projects can be 2-6-week bursts and most of them are directly driven by our customers' desire to see some capability in Oracle Cloud.
* Desire to collaborate and innovate to create solutions.

## Interview Schedule

The face-to-face interview process is a technical interview outlined below:

## Technical Presentation and Process Presentation - up to 45 minutes

| Interview Section | Minutes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | 3 - 5 | Brief overview of yourself. Try to sell yourself and explain why you are best to fit for this role|
| Journey to Cloud Presentation | 15 | Brief overview of Oracle's cloud platform to a potential customer that is interested in making the journey to the cloud |
| Functional Deep dive - Business Use Case Whiteboarding | 15 | Demonstrate how you can navigate key SaaS business process to define solution for your customer |  
| Technical/Functional Q & A Interview | 10 | Technical/Functional Question and Answer Interview - Expect to be asked about projects where you were a MAJOR contributor |

## Overview

During this presentation, we ask that you provide a brief overview of yourself, including your functional and technical experience and skills. It's not necessary to go into detail, as we will ask more questions during the **Technical/Functional Question and Answer Interview** section of the interview.

## Journey to Cloud: Presentation

The scenario for the presentation is one where you need to present a technical/business overview of Oracle’s cloud platform to a potential customer that is interested in making the journey to the cloud. The customer audience consists of technical and business level attendees. This customer is interested in moving to the cloud but is not sure whether it makes sense and whether Oracle is the right vendor.  It is important to address both the business value and the technical value of the proposed solution. For this role we expect you to do some reasearch on Oracle SaaS solutions, value propositions and why Oracle SaaS is best fit for your customer.

This **presentation** should be no longer than <u>**15 minutes**</u> and can be based on the content found in the links provided below.A [Powerpoint deck is available at this link](FY18_Candidate_Cloud_SaaS_Presentation.pptx). You do not have to use this specific presentation so feel free to customize it.  We suggest that you use your own words in presenting the slides. We like to see your research in Oracle SaaS space. (ERP/HCM/CXM)

Key focus areas:
- Expect the audience to ask for clarification on any content you show and actively INTERRUPT
- Make sure you know the differences between DaaS, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.
- Do NOT read out of your notes!.

- How did you get involved in this project (We prefer individual project OR a team project that is not coursework related)
- How big was the team (if there was one)
- What is your specific role and contribution ( For example: I coded front-end and collected requirements for project OR I coded some piece of the front-end) We are looking for "I" not "WE"
- Walk through the solution and functional architecture
- What was outcome in terms of ROI, Business Value
